# Limitations of this QuestWorlds system module

While the QuestWorlds SRD is still in a state of flux, this implementation of a Foundry system module for QuestWorlds offers only the minimum necessary features to play QuestWorlds in Foundry. The goals of the first release were:

- characters sheets that cover all necessary information for a PC
- simple contests with basic support for modifiers and variable resistance

While I would love to automate a lot of the paperwork and logic of QuestWorlds, accomplishing these two core goals is enough to allow the GM and players to handle the details manually. As an unexpected side effect, this also makes it useful for playing earlier editions of HQ and HW that use slightly different logic, modifier scales, and contest rules.

Only the simplest logic of simple contests is managed by this QuestWorlds system module, by giving the GM the opportunity to set the base resistance and the player the opportunity to input the total of modifiers.

Opportunities for automation—that is, things I would like to see later—include:

- guided character creation, 
- automation of some advancement mechanics, 
- automatic and menu-driven roll bonuses and penalties, 
- gaining and spending Hero Points and Experience Points, 
- built-in tools for managing long contest
